## Work Done
- Write the html structure and the script.
By doing that, I knew which elements i had to modify and edit to complete the challenge.

- Add Event Listeneres.
First thing to do was validate if the form has all the needed values as input, if not it will show an alert.
Then i declared an async function that would let me fetch the data of the currency that i want to be used.

If the fetch didnÂ´t have problems, i would be able to do the math and calculate the right conversion.

As needed, i declared another async function to look up the data of the past 10 days. With that data, i made use of CanvasJS to create a linear graph of the price fluctuation each day for the selected currency. 
- Add the Readme.
